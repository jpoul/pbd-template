# Blueprint: React TypeScript Firebase Todo Application

This blueprint outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Todo application as specified in the specification document.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

### Step 1: Project Initialization
1. Create a new React TypeScript project using Vite
2. Set up Firebase project and configure services (Authentication, Firestore)
3. Configure ESLint, Prettier, and testing framework (Jest + React Testing Library)
4. Implement CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Step 2: Core Application Structure
1. Set up application routing with React Router
2. Create layout components (Header, Footer, Layout)
3. Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
4. Configure Firebase hosting and deployment

## Phase 2: Authentication System

### Step 3: User Authentication
1. Implement Firebase Authentication context
2. Create login and registration pages
3. Build password reset functionality
4. Add protected routes for authenticated content

### Step 4: User Profile Management
1. Create user profile document in Firestore
2. Implement profile editing functionality
3. Add user preferences storage
4. Create avatar upload with Firebase Storage

## Phase 3: Todo Management Core Functionality

### Step 5: Todo Data Model
1. Design and implement Firestore data model for todos
2. Create CRUD service for todo operations
3. Set up real-time synchronization for todo data
4. Implement data validation and error handling

### Step 6: Todo List Interface
1. Create todo list component with filtering capabilities
2. Implement todo item component with status toggling
3. Add sorting functionality (by date, priority, status)
4. Create skeleton loading states for asynchronous operations

### Step 7: Todo Creation and Editing
1. Implement todo creation form with validation
2. Create editing interface for existing todos
3. Add due date selection with date picker
4. Implement priority level selection

## Phase 4: Organization and Productivity Features

### Step 8: Categories and Tags
1. Design and implement category data model
2. Create category management interface
3. Add tag functionality for todos
4. Implement filtering by categories and tags

### Step 9: Calendar View
1. Create calendar view interface
2. Implement todo placement on calendar based on due dates
3. Add drag-and-drop functionality for rescheduling
4. Create month, week, and day view options

### Step 10: Notifications and Reminders
1. Implement browser notifications for due todos
2. Create email notification service
3. Add reminder setting functionality
4. Implement notification preferences

## Phase 5: Performance and Deployment

### Step 11: Performance Optimization
1. Implement lazy loading for application routes
2. Add pagination for large todo lists
3. Optimize Firestore queries
4. Set up Firebase caching strategies

### Step 12: Final Deployment
1. Configure proper security rules for Firestore
2. Set up monitoring and error reporting
3. Implement analytics tracking
4. Deploy to production environment

## Timeline and Milestones
- Project Setup and Authentication: 2 weeks
- Core Todo Functionality: 3 weeks
- Organization Features: 2 weeks
- Performance and Deployment: 1 week

## Technical Considerations
- State management will use React Context and hooks
- Firestore security rules will enforce user-based access control
- Real-time updates will be implemented using Firestore listeners
- All components will be developed using Test-Driven Development
